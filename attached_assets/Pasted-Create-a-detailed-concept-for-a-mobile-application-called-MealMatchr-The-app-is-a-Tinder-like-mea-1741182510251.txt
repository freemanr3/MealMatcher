Create a detailed concept for a mobile application called "MealMatchr." The app is a Tinder-like meal planning app that helps users create meals based on the ingredients they already have at home. The app allows users to "swipe" through meal options generated from their available ingredients and dietary restrictions/preferences (such as vegetarian, gluten-free, low-carb, etc.).

App Concept:

Users input a list of ingredients they already have in their fridge, freezer, or pantry.
They set dietary restrictions or preferences (vegan, keto, dairy-free, etc.).
The app presents meal ideas, one at a time, with photos and brief descriptions — users can swipe right if they like it or left if they want to pass.
Meals they swipe right on are saved to their personal meal plan or shopping list.
Premium Features (Subscription Options):

Smart Ingredient Scanning: Use the phone camera to scan ingredients directly into the app.
Nutritional Info & Calorie Breakdown: Detailed nutritional information for each meal.
AI Chef Recommendations: AI suggests meal improvements, substitutions, or pro tips.
Meal Prep & Batch Cooking Plans: Weekly meal plans tailored to their ingredients.
Smart Shopping List Integration: Automatically creates a shopping list for missing ingredients.
Exclusive Recipes: Access to premium recipes from professional chefs and nutritionists.

MealMatchr Social: Connect with friends or family to plan meals together, share saved meals, or even vote on what to cook.
Leftover Makeover Mode: Specifically helps users make meals using leftover or near-expiry items.
Seasonal Recipe Alerts: Get recipe ideas based on seasonal ingredients.
